*   **Live Web Preview**: Instantly visualize changes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript projects in a dedicated preview panel, supporting responsive design modes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Backend Code Execution**: Execute code for supported backend languages directly within the editor using the Piston API, displaying output or errors in a console.
*   **Integrated Console**: A dynamic console for viewing JavaScript/TypeScript output, errors, and warnings from the live preview.
*   **File and Project Management**: Organize code efficiently with a file explorer that supports creating, deleting, and managing projects, folders, and individual files.
*   **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes for personalized comfort.
*   **Font Size Adjustment**: Customize editor font size to suit individual preferences.
*   **Auto-Save Functionality**: Automatically saves project progress to local storage, ensuring work is never lost.
*   **Shareable Code URLs**: Generate and share unique URLs that encapsulate your project's code, making collaboration effortless.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run CodeEditor locally.

### Installation
To get a copy of this project running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  ### Clone the Repository
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Just-Tara/code-editor.git
    ```

2.  ### Navigate to the Project Directory
    Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd code-editor
    ```

3.  ### Install Dependencies
    Install the required Node.js packages using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  ### Run the Development Server
    Start the development server. This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Environment Variables
This project does not require specific environment variables for local development. It utilizes `emkc.org/api/v2/piston` directly for backend language execution.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start coding and experimenting with different languages.

### 🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript)
*   **Create Files**: Use the "Add New File" button or context menu in the File Explorer to create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`  files.
*   **Write Code**: Edit your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript in the respective editor tabs.
*   **Live Preview**: The "Preview" panel will automatically update to reflect your changes for web projects.
*   **Console Output**: For JavaScript/TypeScript, any `console.log()`, `console.error()`, etc., will appear in the integrated console at the bottom of the screen.

### 💻 Backend Development (Python, Java, PHP, Go, C, C++, Ruby, Shell)
*   **Create Files**: Create a new file with the appropriate extension (e.g., `main.py` for Python).
*   **Write Code**: Enter your backend logic in the editor.
*   **Run Code**: Click the "Run Code" button in the header. The application will send your code to the Piston API for execution.
*   **View Output**: The result (stdout or stderr) will be displayed in the "Preview" panel, indicating success or any errors.

### 🗄️ File and Project Management
*   **File Explorer**: On the left, you'll find a file explorer. Click the folder icon in the editor tabs to toggle its visibility.
*   **Create Project**: Use the `+ Project` button to create new, independent coding environments.
*   **Create Folder/File**: Within a project, use the `+ Folder` or `+ File` buttons to organize your code. You can also right-click on projects or folders for these options.
*   **Delete**: Delete projects, folders, or files using the trashcan icon next to their names.
*   **Switch Files/Tabs**: Click on file names in the File Explorer or the Editor Tabs to switch between open files.

### ✨ Editor Features
*   **Theme Toggle**: Use the sun/moon icon in the header (or settings menu on mobile) to switch between dark and light themes.
*   **Font Size**: Adjust the font size with the `A⁺` and `A⁻` buttons in the header (or settings menu on mobile).
*   **Auto-Save**: Toggle auto-save functionality in the header to automatically save your projects to local storage.
*   **Format Code**: Click the "Format" button to automatically format the code in the active editor.
*   **Share Code**: Click "Share" to copy a unique URL to your clipboard that recreates your current project's state for sharing.
